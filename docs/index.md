  Use the Azure Landing Zones (ALZ) provider to generate data to allow you to easily provision your ALZ configuration.
  You must configure the provider with the proper credentials before you can use it.

  This provider has been designed to work with the [ALZ Terraform module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/avm-ptn-alz/azurerm/latest).
  We suggest that you consume this provider from within the module, rather than directly in your Terraform configuration.

# ALZ

Use the Azure Landing Zones (ALZ) provider to generate data to allow you to easily provision your ALZ configuration.
Its principal use is to generate data to deploy resources with the [AzureRM](https://github.com/Azure/terraform-provider-azurerm) provider.
However, the provider does deploy some resources directly, in order to work around limitations in Terraform.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

~> **Important** This provider has been designed to work with the [ALZ Terraform module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/avm-ptn-alz/azurerm/latest). We suggest that you consume this provider from within the module, rather than directly in your Terraform configuration.

~> **Warning** This provider is still in development but is ready for initial testing and feedback via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Azure/terraform-provider-alz/issues).

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "alz" {
  lib_dirs = [
    "${path.root}/lib"
  ]
}
```

## Authentication and Configuration

Configuration for the ALZ provider can be derived from several sources, which are applied in the following order:

1. Parameters in the provider configuration
1. Environment variables

## Versions

For production use, you should constrain the acceptable provider versions via
configuration, to ensure that new versions with breaking changes will not be
automatically installed by `terraform init` in the future:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    alz = {
      source  = "azure/alz"
      version = "<version>" # change this to your desired version, https://www.terraform.io/language/expressions/version-constraints
    }
  }
}
```

As this provider is still at version zero, you should constrain the acceptable
provider versions on the minor version.

## Schema

### Optional

- `allow_lib_overwrite` (Boolean) Whether to allow overwriting of library artifacts by subsequent libraries. Default is `false`.
- `auxiliary_tenant_ids` (List of String) A list of auxiliary tenant ids which should be used. If not specified, value will be attempted to be read from the `ARM_AUXILIARY_TENANT_IDS` environment variable. When configuring from the environment, use a semicolon as a delimiter.
- `client_certificate_password` (String, Sensitive) The password associated with the client certificate. For use when authenticating as a service principal using a client certificate. If not specified, value will be attempted to be read from the `ARM_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` environment variable.
- `client_certificate_path` (String) The path to the client certificate associated with the service principal for use when authenticating as a service principal using a client certificate. If not specified, value will be attempted to be read from the `ARM_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH` environment variable.
- `client_id` (String) The client id which should be used. For use when authenticating as a service principal. If not specified, value will be attempted to be read from the `ARM_CLIENT_ID` environment variable.
- `client_secret` (String, Sensitive) The client secret which should be used. For use when authenticating as a service principal using a client secret. If not specified, value will be attempted to be read from the `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable.
- `environment` (String) The cloud environment which should be used. Possible values are `public`, `usgovernment` and `china`. Defaults to `public`. If not specified, value will be attempted to be read from the `ARM_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable.
- `lib_urls` (List of String) A list of directories or URLs to use for ALZ libraries. The URLs will be processed in order. See <https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/go-getter#readme-url-format> for URL syntax. Note that if use_alz_lib is set to true then it will always be the first library used.
- `oidc_request_token` (String, Sensitive) The bearer token for the request to the OIDC provider. For use when authenticating using OpenID Connect. If not specified, value will be attempted to be read from the first non-empty value of the `ARM_OIDC_REQUEST_TOKEN` and `ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_TOKEN` environment variables.
- `oidc_request_url` (String) The URL for the OIDC provider from which to request an id token. For use when authenticating as a service principal using OpenID Connect. If not specified, value will be attempted to be read from the first non-empty value of the `ARM_OIDC_REQUEST_URL` and `ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL` environment variables.
- `oidc_token` (String, Sensitive) The OIDC id token for use when authenticating as a service principal using OpenID Connect. If not specified, value will be attempted to be read from the `ARM_OIDC_TOKEN` environment variable.
- `oidc_token_file_path` (String) The path to a file containing an OIDC id token for use when authenticating using OpenID Connect. If not specified, value will be attempted to be read from the `ARM_OIDC_TOKEN_FILE_PATH` environment variable.
- `skip_provider_registration` (Boolean) Should the provider skip registering all of the resource providers that it supports, if they're not already registered? Default is `false`. If not specified, value will be attempted to be read from the `ARM_SKIP_PROVIDER_REGISTRATION` environment variable.
- `tenant_id` (String) The Tenant ID which should be used. If not specified, value will be attempted to be read from the `ARM_TENANT_ID` environment variable.
- `use_alz_lib` (Boolean) Use the default ALZ library to resolve archetypes. Default is `true`.
- `use_cli` (Boolean) Allow Azure CLI to be used for authentication. Default is `true`. If not specified, value will be attempted to be read from the `ARM_USE_CLI` environment variable.
- `use_msi` (Boolean) Allow managed service identity to be used for authentication. Default is `false`. If not specified, value will be attempted to be read from the `ARM_USE_MSI` environment variable.
- `use_oidc` (Boolean) Allow OpenID Connect to be used for authentication. Default is `false`. If not specified, value will be attempted to be read from the `ARM_USE_OIDC` environment variable.
